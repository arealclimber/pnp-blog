summary: 'I should say sorry to myself, not to anyone else.'

They don't see me as an individual.

They view me as a collection of behaviors filtered through their emotions.

When I blame myself for their claims, I'm harming myself. I stand opposed to my precious one and only one self.

When I portray and market myself as a product in a resume or job interview, I break myself down, adopting the perspectives of others.

But that doesn't mean I must remain stuck in this position. I objectify myself to understand how others perceive me and to negotiate the best offer.

Afterward, I need to return to being the subject of my life. I should remember that I am the one who truly understands my emotions—why I'm happy, overwhelmed, irritated, delighted, enlightened, inspired, depressed, distracted, pleased, satisfied.
