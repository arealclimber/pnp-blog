### Scenario 1: The “Last-Minute Hero” Routine

**Signal**
You somehow let the deadline creep so close that you’re pulling an all-nighter—again. A small part of you _needs_ the time pressure because it turns a simple task into a drama big enough to match your self-image.

**Try This**

1. **Name the fear out loud.** Say (even to a roommate or into your Notes app), “If I finish early, people will expect this level every time—and that scares me.” Saying it shrinks it.
2. **Micro-commit:** Text a friend, “I’ll send you a rough draft by 4 p.m.—hold me to it.” External eyes break the spell.
3. **Reward completion, not perfection:** The moment the _first_ version is done, grab a coffee, take a lap—whatever signals “task closed.” You’re teaching your brain that finishing fast = good feelings.

### Scenario 2: Endless Polishing That No One Asked For

**Signal**
You keep “tweaking” a slide deck long past the point stakeholders have stopped caring. Secretly, you’re dodging the next, scarier step (presenting, shipping, applying).

**Try This**

1. **Set a “feature freeze.”** Announce: “No edits after lunch—only typo fixes.” Treat it like code freeze.
2. **Shift the goalpost:** Ask, “What decision does this deck need to unlock?” If it already answers that, hit send.
3. **Use a launch phrase:** Practice saying, “It’s 80 percent polished; feedback will get it the last 20.” That sentence moves you from maker to collaborator.

### Scenario 3: Pre-Emptive Self-Downplay in Conversations

**Signal**
You open a meeting with, “This might be a dumb idea, but…” or you pitch salary expectations below market “to be reasonable.” You think you’re modest; you’re handing away leverage.

**Try This**

1. **Replace disclaimers with context.** Swap “dumb idea” for “quick hypothesis.” Same honesty, zero self-sabotage.
2. **Anchor high, then flex:** Practice: “Based on market data, I’m targeting NT\$1.6–1.8 M. Let’s discuss how that aligns with the role.” You keep wiggle room _after_ setting a strong anchor.
3. **Borrow credibility:** Lead with a win: “After cutting crash rates by 80 percent, I realized the same pattern fits here.” People hear results first, reservations later.

### Scenario 4: Creating Chaos Right Before Success

**Signal**
Offer letter arrives and—boom—you pick a fight with your roommate, binge-buy gadgets, or catch a mysterious flu. Body language for “Change is scary.”

**Try This**

1. **Plan a “safe chaos” outlet.** Schedule a weekend hike, boxing class—something physically intense _after_ the milestone. Gives the adrenaline a parking space.
2. **Draft the next goal early.** The brain calms when it sees another mountain to climb. Write: “First 90 days—ship X, learn Y.” Success becomes a stepping stone, not a cliff edge.
3. **Use the mantra:** “I can enjoy the win _and_ stay me.” Sounds cheesy; works because it addresses the hidden fear of identity loss.

### One-Minute Self-Audit

1. **Scan today’s calendar.** Where am I likely to procrastinate or over-polish?
2. **Write one sentence of “fear translation.”** (e.g., “I’m stalling because handing this off means I’m on the hook for results.”)
3. **Pick a micro-action that proves the fear wrong.** Hit send, book the meeting, draft the outline—then close your laptop with a grin.
