The insights on cognitive resource allocation in the video ([how to learn any skill so fast it feels illegal](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bSDprg24pEA)) mirrored what I’ve noticed in my learning journey.

# **The Challenge of Overloading My Brain**

A key point from the video is the importance of avoiding overloading my brain. Trying to learn too many different things at the same time, or attempting to learn things that are too difficult all at once, can stretch my brain's cognitive resources thin. This can lead to cognitive overload, where my brain gets overwhelmed and simply can't keep up, essentially "frying". The result? I might spend a lot of time studying but feel like I aren't actually learning or absorbing anything.

# **Strategies for Effective Learning**

To learn more effectively and avoid this overload, there're several strategies:

- **Balance Theory and Practice:** It is recommended to **allocate time between learning the theory and engaging in practical application or practice**. While the specific ratio can vary depending on the skill's difficulty and how quickly I can make it a habit, a suggested starting point might be 1 hour of theory for every 5 hours of practice. This 5-hour figure might need constant adjustment. The essential principle is to find the right balance between understanding the concepts and actively practicing them. The difficulty of the skill significantly impacts this ratio; for example, learning to tie shoelaces is very different from learning advanced mathematics.

- **Learn Slowly:** Counterintuitively, **the fastest way to learn is often by learning slowly**. Trying to master things quickly dramatically increases the difficulty, making the learning curve exponentially steeper. **Patience is therefore crucial** in the learning process.

- **Prioritize:** Recognizing that "you can do anything, but you cannot do everything" is fundamental. I **must prioritize which skills I choose to learn**.

# **Relating to My Personal Experience**

I took over backend accounting projects, which felt very overwhelming, especially because concepts were highly abstracted. The difficulty was likely due to not having a strong grasp of backend architecture and knowledge, and not having had much experience before transitioning into that role. If it were simple, then my previous colleagues wouldn't have been doing anything. Overcoming this difficulty involves **learning the theory combined with practical experience**, such as writing down notes little by little. While conceptually simple, this approach still requires allocating cognitive resources to learn.

**I’d say that asking for help serves me too.**

# **Focus is a Limited Resource**

A significant point emphasized is that **concentration and focus are limited resources**. Therefore, intentionally directing my attention is vital. My recent goal exemplifies this: reviewing items on my resume and related knowledge/skills. My approach is to **plan goals one by one and then focus solely on completing them**, actively avoiding procrastination or mixing in other activities I want to do. This dedication is seen as a commitment to myself, helping me become more reliable, and is a habit that must be cultivated.

# **Conclusion**

Ultimately, effective cognitive skill learning isn't about speed or trying to absorb everything at once. It's about **respecting my brain's cognitive limitations**, **learning at a measured pace**, **balancing theoretical knowledge with practical application**, and **strategically choosing and focusing on specific goals**. So I can avoid feeling overwhelmed and achieve deeper, more lasting learning.
