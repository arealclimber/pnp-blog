In today’s rapidly evolving landscape, the ability to achieve what you want often comes down to three fundamental principles: Permissionless action, clear Priorities, and continuous Progress. Let’s break these down.

# Permissionless

You don't need approval to start. Whether it’s joining a competition, initiating a side project, or creating your website, the only real barrier is often your own hesitation. Most opportunities require little more than a willingness to try. The internet has removed traditional gatekeepers, providing endless knowledge and resources at your fingertips. Take action—no permissions needed. Just do it.

# Priority

After embracing a permissionless mindset, determining your priorities is essential. With countless opportunities available, clarity on what genuinely matters to you ensures you invest your energy effectively. Identifying and committing to these priorities helps avoid overwhelm and fosters deeper, meaningful progress.

# Progress

With permission to act and clear priorities set, maintaining consistent progress is key. Define measurable goals and frequently reflect on your progress. Embrace learning and adaptation as essential parts of your journey. Consistently reviewing and refining your approach keeps you moving steadily towards your objectives.

In summary, harnessing these three Ps — Permissionless, Priority, and Progress—can transform your mindset and drive sustained growth. Step forward confidently and purposefully into your ambitions.

Don't let your own doubts hinder you.
