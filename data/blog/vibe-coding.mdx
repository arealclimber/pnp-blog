## The Definition of Vibe Coding  

The term “vibe coding” was coined by Andrej Karpathy around February 2025.

It refers to the concept where developers fully give in to the vibes, embrace exponentials, and momentarily forget that the code even exists.  

## How I Collaborate with AI in Programming  

I’ve been working with AI for coding since last year, when Cursor introduced the “Composer” mode (later renamed “Agent” mode). 

In my experience, AI can make mistakes during collaboration. 

Instead of manually revising the code, I provide the AI with additional documentation or examples for reference. 

This approach helps the AI align more effectively with my expectations.  



My go-to notes for vibe coding with Cursor are to copy the .cursorrules file from one repository, paste it into the one I’m working on, and prepare all related references.  

As a full-stack developer, it’s best to gather resources like mockup screenshots, relevant API information from the wiki, and meeting minutes about implementation—especially if the tasks are complex. 

If the meeting minutes are chaotic, I put them into a random repository and open a new chat with o1 mini to summarize them.  

However, when I ask the AI to do a job, I attach only the bare minimum documentation so as not to overwhelm it. Later, if the AI cannot finish multiple tasks at once, I split them into smaller tasks and open a new chat in Cursor to start over.  Example Task – Revise API  For example, I was assigned the task of revising a specific API. I gathered documents such as the API endpoint and request/response examples in the prompt. My prompt includes a request to plan in .cursorrules beforehand and to write any lessons learned after the tasks are executed.  The process is iterative. Each time the AI submits a result, I pay close attention to whether it records the lesson in .cursorrules. This prevents repetitive mistakes and helps in gaining a better understanding of the codebase.  Example Task – Modify API Document  Another example: if I need to revise or create an API wiki based on the latest mockup changes, I take screenshots of the updated frames in the mockup and create a new file to add three or four existing APIs. The documentation task is relatively simple, so it’s likely to be completed in one go. Just make sure the screenshots align with the API.

## How I collaborate with AI in programming

I've been working with AI for coding since last year when Cursor introduced the "Composer" mode, later renamed "Agent" mode. In my experience, AI can make mistakes during collaboration. Instead of manually revising the code, I provide the AI with more documentation or examples as references to follow. This approach helps the AI align with my expectations more effectively.



My go-to notes on vibe coding with Cursor is to copy [.cursorrules on this repo](https://github.com/grapeot/devin.cursorrules/blob/master/.cursorrules) and paste it into the repo I’m working on and prepare all related references. 

As a full stack developer, it'd be better to collect documents like screenshots of mockup, certain APIs information in wiki and meeting minutes about implementation if the tasks are complicated.

If the meeting minutes are chaotic, I put them into random repo and open new chat to ask o1 mini to summarize. 

However, when I ask AI to do the job, I attach the bare minimum level of document so it's not overwhelming to AI.

Later, if AI could finish the tasks at once, I split the tasks into smaller ones and open new chat in Cursor to start over.



## Example task - revise API

For example, I've been assigned the task of revising a specific API. I gathered documents like API endpoint, request and response examples in prompt.

My prompt includes the request to plan in `.cursorrules` beforehand and write the lessons learned after it executes the tasks.

The process is iterative. Each time they submit the result, I pay close attention if it records the lesson in `.cursorrules` to prevent repetitive mistakes and to gain a better understanding of the codebase.



## Example task - modify API document

Another example, if I need to revise or create an API wiki based on the latest changes in mockup, I will take screenshots on updated frames in mockup, and create a new file to paste 3-4 existing APIs. 

The documentation task is relatively simple, so it's likely to finish it at once. Just make sure that the screenshot aligns with the API.
