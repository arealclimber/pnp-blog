They can't see me as an individual.

They see me as a collection of behavior with the cover of their emotions.

When I blame myself for their claims, I abuse myself. I stand against me—the only precious me. When I build and sell myself as a product on a resume and job interview, I break me down and stand in others' shoes. But it doesn't mean I have to be stuck in this position. I objectify me so I can know how people see me and try to get the best offer. Afterward, I should go back to where I am, be the subject of my life. I should know I will be the person who catches my every piece of emotion, sensing why I'm happy, collapsed, overwhelmed, irritated, annoyed, delighted, enlightened, inspired.

They don't see me as an individual; they view me as a collection of behaviors filtered through their emotions. When I blame myself for their claims, I'm harming myself. I stand opposed to my one-of-a-kind self. When I portray and market myself as a product in a résumé or job interview, I break myself down, adopting the perspectives of others. But that doesn't mean I must remain stuck in this position. I objectify myself to understand how others perceive me and to negotiate the best offer. Afterward, I need to return to being the subject of my life. I should remember that I am the one who truly understands my emotions—why I'm happy, overwhelmed, irritated, delighted, enlightened, or inspired.
