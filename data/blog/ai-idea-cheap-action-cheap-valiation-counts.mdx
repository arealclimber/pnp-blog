I just finished a talk where I was able to speak openly about my thoughts on AI. I invited the other person to challenge my thinking by posing tough questions.

Here’s the conclusion I’m excited to share: **the real competition today is about adaptability.**

In the past, engineers held the power because they were the ones who could turn ideas into reality. But now, AI gives that power to everyone—even those who can’t code. As a result, **ideas are no longer rare, and taking action has become cheap,** because anyone can bring an idea to life instantly.

This shifts the focus to a different question: **Are we solving a real problem, or just an imaginary one?**

At this stage, validation becomes essential. The market will tell you whether you're solving something meaningful. Customers show you—through their actions—whether your solution truly matters to them. Based on that feedback, you can iterate and refine your product accordingly.

So now, the race isn’t just about building fast—it’s about **validating fast, learning fast, and adapting fast.**

**Realizing that you are permissionless in everything is the first step toward unlocking your full potential.**
