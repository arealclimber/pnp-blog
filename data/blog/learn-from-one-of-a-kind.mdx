# Progress matters more than perfection

- Here's the lessons I learnt from English tutor and my reflections

Life is too short to wait, so just accept the challenge that interests you.

Life is too long to regret, so take small steps toward your ideal life.

And you can simmer along the way.

You don't have to figure out the path immediately.

Moreover, you'd grow a lot faster if you enjoy making mistakes.

# Adaptability and Intelligence

There're observations I made from my colleague, particularly concerning adaptability, problem-solving, and continuous learning.

- **Learning Through Experimentation:** She uses trial and error to solve problems, experimenting with different approaches to tasks and learning from the outcomes.
- **Summarizing and Reflecting on Mistakes:** She's intelligence lies in her ability to summarize and reflect on her mistakes, which allows her to remember lessons and apply them to similar situations in the future. By taking notes on her errors, she can effectively address similar issues.

### Reflections & Learnings

- **Importance of a System:** The experience underscores the importance of having a system to handle new challenges and being adaptive in the face of constant change.
