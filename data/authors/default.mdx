A real climber?

But the mountain is MYSELF.

> Your mountain is the block between you and the life you want to live. Facing it is also the only path to your freedom and becoming. You are here because a trigger showed you to your wound, and your wound will show you to your path, and your path will show you to your destiny.

(quote from [The Mountain Is You by Brianna Wiest](https://www.kobo.com/ww/en/ebook/the-mountain-is-you-6))
