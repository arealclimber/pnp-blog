I'm a person, writer, and problem-solver.

Don’t leave anything for later <br />
Later coffee gets cold <br />
Later you lose interest <br />
Later you grow older <br />
Later life goes by <br />
Later time slips away <br />
Later you regret not doing something <br />
So stop waiting for the perfect moment <br />
There won’t be a perfect moment <br />
Do it today and do it now <br />
Because life is happening <br />
RIGHT NOW <br />
