The trivial routines of daily life often feel like a cage, making me forget my goals and passions.

Do I still remember those moments that once made my eyes light up?

Can I confidently tell myself—especially in moments of failure—that at least I’ve stayed healthy, both mentally and physically, and that I’ve learned something along the way?

Even after all the hard work, anxiety still lingers. Every step into a new field feels shaky and uncertain. I often feel the need to offer emotional value when I doubt the professional value I bring.

Who am I? What sparks my focus and excitement?

It’s okay to crave different things at different stages of life. I always give myself the time to explore—free from the pressure of society’s timeline.

I define my life.
